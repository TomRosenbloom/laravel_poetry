Just a stub currently - destined to be a Laravel re-write of django_poetry (database of poets, their poems and places of publication).

What has stopped me with this one is I can't immediately see how to replicate what I did very easily in Django wrt persons/names of persons/poets, i.e. have a one-to-many rel between Person and PersonName and Poet extending Person.
